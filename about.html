                <p>Hi! My name is Hana Chohan. I'm currently a second-year Computer Science student at the 
                Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle. Go
                huskies!! I'm from San Diego, CA so I'm still getting used to the rainy weather. I love to
                learn about programming, UX/UI design, and marketing. My current project is building this
                website using HTML and CSS :) I also know Java and have experience wth C++, Python, Ruby on
                Rails, and Swift.</p>
                <h3>Work experience</h3>
                <img src="Bionano.jfif" alt="Interns at Bionano" height="100px" padding-right="30px">
                <p>I'm so lucky to have real work experience that helps me in so many different ways! My
                customer service experience honed my people skills by teaching me how to successfully
                communicate, collaborate, and remain patient in difficult situations. This summer, I got
                to intern at Bionano Genomics as a Software Sales Intern and I gained so much valuable
                experience in a real corporate setting.</p>
